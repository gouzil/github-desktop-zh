# A Repository Non-Updated Branches

This is mostly crafted so we can test how we fast-forward branches with Git.

Scenarios to test:

- branches behind their upstream (`branch-behind`)
- branches ahead their upstream (`branch-ahead`)
- branches ahead and behind their upstream (`branch-ahead-and-behind`)
- branches up-to-date (`branch-up-to-date`)
- current branch behind its upstream (`main`)
