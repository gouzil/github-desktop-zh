4. Under the **Details** section in **Add app password** enter a label for your password

5. Under **Permissions** select `Read` and `Write` in the **Repositories** section to ensure that GitHub Desktop has the correct read/write access to your Bitbucket repositories.

6. Click **Create** to create a new token, and then copy the token to your clipboard.

## Cloning your Bitbucket repository in GitHub Desktop

 1. Open GitHub Desktop and go to **File** > **Clone Repository** > **URL**. Enter the Git URL of your Bitbucket repository. Make sure you enter the correct URL, which should have the following structure:

      `https://bitbucket.com/<username>/<repository>`

 2. You will receive an `Authentication Failed` error. Enter your Bitbucket username and paste in the token you just copied to your clipboard as your password. Click **Save and Retry** to successfully clone the repository to your local machine in GitHub Desktop.

   - **Note:** Your Bitbucket credentials will be securely stored on your local machine so you will not need to repeat this process when cloning another repository from Bitbucket.
