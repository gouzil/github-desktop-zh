# Writing Release Notes

Here's some basic guidelines for how we write our release notes and what we include in them. `yarn draft-release` is a great starting point, but not a final version.

## Anatomy of a Release Note üë©üèº‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

A release note has three (or four) parts.

```
[Tag] Description of work or change - #{issue_number}
```

If it was done by an external contributor, we'll add an extra part ‚Äî a thank you!

```
[Tag] Description of work or change - #{issue_number}. Thanks @{contributor_username}!
```

## Writing Style üñäÔ∏è 

These mostly apply to writing the release note description itself.

### User Facing

We don't include release notes that don't impact the user's experience using Desktop. For example, we wouldn't include a release note about fixing our Appveyor CI config or upgrading Electron.

#### Exceptions for Security Vulnerability Fixes

We'll make exceptions for security vulnerability fixes, especially if they're high profile. These are typically general in nature and do not include the CVE for the vulnerability. For example:

```
[Fixed] Update embedded Git to address security vulnerability - #4791
```

### User Impact

We describe our work in terms of impact on our users, not technical process. How does this work change the user's workflow or experience? What does it help them do?

For example, we might say this:

```
[Fixed] Keep PR badge on top of progress bar - #8622
```

but **not** this:

```
[Fixed] Increase z-index of the progress bar PR badge - #8622
```

### Present Tense

We attempt to use present tense unless it significantly reduces clarity.

For example, we might say this:

```
[Added] Add external editor integration for Xcode - #8255
```

but **not** this:

```
[Added] Adding external editor integration for Xcode - #8255
```

### Verbiage

Although it is often tempting to use the tag prefix as the first word of the release note, we prefer to keep the release note description separate from the tag so that the description is readable by itself.

For example, we might say this:

```
[Improved] Always fast forward recent branches after fetch - #7761
```

but **not** this:

```
[Improved] Branch fast-forwarding after fetch - #7761
```

## Tags üõÑ

We use five different tags to organize our release notes: `[New]`, `[Added]`, `[Fixed]`, `[Improved]`, `[Removed]`. Here's when to use which one.

These aren't hard and fast rules or categories, üôÉ so utilize with your own judgment and nuance.

### Sorting and Ordering of Tags

We sort the release notes by tag, following this order:

1. `[New]`
2. `[Added]`
3. `[Fixed]`
4. `[Improved]`
5. `[Removed]`

(The order of release notes within each tag group is fairly arbitrary.)

### [New]

[New] is usually reserved for our shiniest features. The note itself might be short and very high level and encapsulate a _lot_ of development work.

A great way to check if we have all the [New] lines we need is to ensure that the lines match the "highlights" or "most important new features" of that given release.

### [Added]

[Added] is basically [New] but for a smaller feature. Or it's just not something that's highlighted as much as the [New] things in this release.

We often use [Added] for new editor and terminal integrations.

### [Fixed]

Good ol' [Fixed], the bread and butter of release notes. We use this to indicate that something was broken but now it's not!

This should be used to describe what was done and how the behavior has improved, not what was wrong. For example, we might say this:

```
[Fixed] Keep conflicting untracked files when bringing changes to another branch - #8084
```

but **not** this:

```
[Fixed] Conflicting untracked files are lost when bringing changes to another branch - #8084
```

### [Improved]

Somewhere in between [Added] and [Fixed] lies [Improved]. The idea is that we've made an existing feature or part of the app better, but it wasn't necessarily broken before. Think of it like an "enhancement" release note.

Does this sound like [Added]? Is that confusing? Yes. The rule of thumb is that if it's a small new end-to-end piece of functionality, it's [Added]. If it's a change to a portion of a feature, it's [Improved].

### [Removed]

This describes a feature that is no longer available in the app. We rarely use it.

An example:

```
[Removed] Remove "Discard all changes" context menu item from Changes list - #7394
```

## Release Channel

It's worth noting we are more rigorous about our release notes for production releases than for beta releases.
